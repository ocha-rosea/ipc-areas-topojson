# Current Work – IPC Areas TopoJSON Toolkit

## Status

**Active** – Geometry structure preservation review

## Problem Statement

The current pipeline filters geometries to polygonal types only via `extract_polygonal_geometry()`. This discards Points, LineStrings, and other geometry types, altering the source data structure. Downstream consumers expect the original geometry hierarchy (including nested GeometryCollections) to be preserved—only simplified and with trimmed properties.

## Planned Fixes

### 1. Preserve Original Geometry Types (Priority: High)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Current behaviour:** All geometry types are retained; only Polygon/MultiPolygon are simplified.  
**Implementation:** Removed `extract_polygonal_geometry()` filter; `simplify_geometry()` now explicitly categorises geometry types.

**Files modified:**

- `rosea_ipc_toolkit/feature_utils.py` – polygon-only filter bypassed
- `rosea_ipc_toolkit/downloader.py` – uses `sanitise_geometry()` only
- `cli/simplify_ipc_global_areas.py` – geometry type validation added

### 2. Handle GeometryCollections Transparently

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Current behaviour:** GeometryCollections are recursively processed; all members preserved with individual validation.  
**Implementation:** Recursive `simplify_geometry()` collects failures per member and summarises in parent.

**Files modified:**

- `cli/simplify_ipc_global_areas.py` – recursive handling with member failure aggregation

### 3. Geometry Type Validation & Documentation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Current behaviour:** Non-simplifiable types (Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString) are documented with `reason: skipped` and `geometry_type` field in the unsimplified report.

**Validation categories:**

- `skipped` – geometry type cannot be simplified (points, lines)
- `unknown_type` – unrecognised geometry type
- `invalid_geometry` – malformed geometry
- `simplification_error` – Shapely failed
- `empty_geometry` – simplification produced empty result
- `no_change` – simplified matches original
- `partial_simplification` – GeometryCollection with mixed results

**Files modified:**

- `cli/simplify_ipc_global_areas.py` – `geometry_type` added to all failure records

### 4. TopoJSON Compatibility for Non-Polygon Types

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Current behaviour:** Point-only datasets handled via `_wrap_topology_points`; `arcs` key always present.  
**Implementation:** Existing workaround verified stable for mixed geometry collections.

**Files modified:**

- `rosea_ipc_toolkit/topology.py` – verified `_wrap_topology_points` handles all edge cases

### 5. Property Retention

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- `color` retained in all outputs (country combined + global datasets) for styling
- `year` removed from global dataset only (still present in country combined files)
- `from` and `to` stripped only from `global_areas_min.topojson` for size reduction

**Files modified:**

- `rosea_ipc_toolkit/downloader.py` – removed color stripping from global dataset

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Output TopoJSON retains all geometry types present in source GeoJSON
- [x] Nested GeometryCollections remain nested in output
- [x] Simplification applies only to line/polygon rings; points pass through
- [ ] File sizes remain comparable (property trimming offsets geometry retention)
- [ ] Existing downstream map renders correctly with updated datasets

## Notes

- IPC API sometimes returns mixed GeometryCollections (polygons + points for area centroids)
- Simplification tolerance and precision flags should continue to work as documented
- Extra-minified global output (`global_areas_min.topojson`) still strips `from`/`to`

## Comparison with PySpark Pipeline

The Python toolkit and the PySpark `ipc_analysis_area_last_round` table now use equivalent logic:

| Aspect | PySpark | Python Toolkit (per country) |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| Partition | `(country, year)` | `feature_key` = `id::{country}::{year}::{area_id}` |
| Date fallback | `coalesce(to_date, from_date)` | `to_date` → `from_date` → `updated_at` |
| Same area in multiple years | Keeps both (separate partitions) | Keeps both (year in key) ✅ |
| Deduplication | `dropDuplicates(["id", "country", "title", "year"])` | `feature_key()` includes year |

**Result:** Combined country TopoJSON contains **one feature per area per year** (latest analysis for that year), matching PySpark behaviour.
